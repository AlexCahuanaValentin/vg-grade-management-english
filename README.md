# **Grade Management System – Technical Overview**

## 🔧 **Project Stack**
- **Backend**: Java 17 (IntelliJ IDEA, Spring Boot)  
- **Frontend**: React (latest stable version)  
- **Database**: MongoDB  

---

## ✅ **Project Purpose**
The goal of the **Grade Management System** is to provide an efficient platform for **tracking student attendance**, **viewing grades by semester and classroom**, **generating classroom rankings based on grades**, and **managing administrative processes** related to students' academic progress.

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions** (Imperatives)
1. **Clone** the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/grade-management.git`  
2. **Navigate** to the backend directory:  
   `cd grade-management/backend`  
3. **Run** the Spring Boot app:  
   `./mvnw spring-boot:run`  
4. **Navigate** to the frontend directory:  
   `cd ../frontend`  
5. **Install** dependencies and **start** the React app:  
   `npm install`  
   `npm start`

## 🧩 **How to Use the App** (Advice with “should”)
- You **should** open `http://localhost:3000` once both the backend and frontend are running.  
- You **should** create a user account to access your grades and attendance information.  
- You **should** submit feedback via the "Support" form to help improve the system.

---

## 🎯 **Future Plans** (Advice & Suggestions)
- We **should** implement a notification system to alert users about important academic events, such as deadlines for administrative processes.  
- We **should** allow the export of grades and attendance reports in PDF/Excel formats.  
- We **should** optimize the grade ranking feature to include additional metrics and customization options.

---
## 💡 **Best Practices & Tips**
- You **should** write unit tests (**JUnit** for the backend, **Jest/React Testing Library** for the frontend).  
- You **should** document any new **REST endpoints** in the README or in a dedicated **API specification**.  
- You **should** run `mvn clean` (backend) and `npm run lint` (frontend) before committing.
